Design a component that renders a tree of comments. Each comment can have replies, and those replies can have replies (n-levels deep). There will be an option to add a new comment and also delete a comment.

## High Level Idea

- It is essentially a tree structure.
- Each comment can have zero or more children.
- When you reply, a new node is added to the tree.
- Deleting a comment removes the node from the tree.

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Architecture Design

- Store the comments in a tree-like structure.
  - Each comment has: `id`, `text`, and `children`.
- The entire comment list is an array of root-level comments.
- Each comment may contain nested levels of comments.

Basically, we will maintain the comments as a tree of objects, where each node represents a comment and contains an array of replies.

**Sample Data Structure:**

```js
const comments = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: 'Hello, how are you?',
    children: []
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: 'I am fine, thank you!',
    children: [
      {
        id: 3,
        text: 'I am good, thank you!',
        children: []
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

### Step 2: Component Structure

1. **CommentList**: Handles the top level of comments.
2. **Comment**: Handles the individual comment. It renders:
   - The comment text.
   - A reply button to add a new reply.
   - A delete button to delete the comment.
   - Children comments recursively.
   - Conditionally, a reply input field when the user clicks reply.

**Components:**
- `CommentList`
- `Comment`

### Step 3: Data Flow

There are three main flows:
- Reply flow
- Delete flow
- Rendering flow

**Reply Flow:**
- User clicks on the reply button.
- A new comment input field is shown.
- When user submits the comment:
  - A new comment object is created.
  - It gets inserted in `parent.children`.
  - State gets updated.
- UI re-renders to show the new comment.

**Delete Flow:**
- User clicks on the delete button.
- The comment is removed from the tree.
- State gets updated.
- UI re-renders to remove the comment.

**Rendering Flow:**
- `CommentList` renders the top-level comments.
- Each `Comment` renders itself and recursively renders children.
- React handles updates automatically.
